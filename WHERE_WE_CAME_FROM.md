# WHERE WE CAME FROM

**Date Created**: November 4, 2025
**Purpose**: Speed/voice testing fork

## ⚠️ NEVER TOUCH THIS REPO AGAIN:

**Old Production Frontend:**
- Repo: `tlfla/voice-bot-separate`
- Branch: `voice-2-enhancement`
- Vercel: Auto-deploys from this repo
- Status: **PRODUCTION - DO NOT MODIFY**

---

## ✅ OUR NEW TESTING REPO (Work Here):

**New Frontend:**
- Repo: `tlfla/voice-bot-frontend-speed-test`
- Branch: `main`
- Vercel: Will point to this repo
- Status: **TESTING ENVIRONMENT**

---

## What We're Testing:

Voice quality improvements on backend:
1. Prompt pacing changes
2. Sonic-3 speed parameter
3. Overall voice fluidity vs Cerebras demo

Frontend remains mostly unchanged except for:
- Updated backend Railway URL (to be added after Railway setup)

---

**IF THIS TESTING WORKS**: We may merge changes back to production repos later.

**IF THIS TESTING FAILS**: This repo becomes reference/archive, production stays untouched.
